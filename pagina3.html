        <p>Clive Staples Lewis FBA (29 November 1898 
             22 November 1963) was a British writer, literary scholar, and Anglican lay theologian. He held 
             academic positions in English literature at both Oxford University (Magdalen College, 1925–1954) and Cambridge
              University (Magdalene College, 1954–1963). He is best known as the author of The Chronicles of Narnia, but he is also
               noted for his other works of fiction, such as The Screwtape Letters and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction 
               Christian apologetics, including Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.
<br>
            Lewis was a close friend of J. R. R. 
            Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings. Both men served on the English faculty at Oxford
             University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. According to
              Lewis's 1955 memoir Surprised by Joy, he was baptized in the Church of Ireland but fell away from his 
              faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien
               and other friends, and he became an "ordinary layman of the Church of England".</p>
